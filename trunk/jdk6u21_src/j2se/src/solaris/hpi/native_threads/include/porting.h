/* There is a handshake between a newly created thread and its creator
 * at thread startup because the creator thread needs to suspend the
 * new thread.  Currently there are two ways to do this -- with
 * semaphores and with mutexes.  The semaphore based implementation is
 * cleaner and hence is the default.  We wish the mutex based one will
 * go away, but turns out the implementation of semaphores on
 * Linux/ppc etc is flaky, so the mutex based solution lives for now.
