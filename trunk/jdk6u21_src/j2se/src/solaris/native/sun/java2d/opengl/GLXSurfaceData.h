/**
 * The GLXSDOps structure contains the GLX-specific information for a given
 * OGLSurfaceData.  It is referenced by the native OGLSDOps structure.
 *
 *     Window window; (used in XAWT only)
 * For onscreen windows, we maintain a reference to that window's associated
 * XWindow handle here.  Offscreen surfaces have no associated Window, so for
 * those surfaces, this value will simply be zero.
 *
 *     Widget widget; (used in MAWT only)
 * For onscreen windows, we maintain a reference to that window's associated
 * Widget handle here.  Offscreen surfaces have no associated Widget, so for
 * those surfaces, this value will simply be zero.
 *
 *     Drawable xdrawable;
 * If a GLXDrawable has a corresponding X11 Drawable, it is stored here.  For
 * example, each GLXWindow has an associated Window and each GLXPixmap has an
 * associated Pixmap.  GLXPbuffers have no associated X11 Drawable (they are
 * pure OpenGL surfaces), so for pbuffers, this field is set to zero;
 *
 *     GLXDrawable drawable;
 * The native handle to the GLXDrawable at the core of this surface.  A
 * GLXDrawable can be a Window, GLXWindow, GLXPixmap, or GLXPbuffer.
 *
 *     AwtGraphicsConfigData *configData;
 * A pointer to the AwtGraphicsConfigData under which this surface was
 * created.
