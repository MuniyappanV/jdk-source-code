<h1 style="text-align: center;">Native Platform Toolkit (NPT) Concept Document <br>
</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Draft: WARNING: May Not Reflect Actual Implementation<br>
</h1>
<br>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Internal to the J2SE, anyone developing JNI code, or interfacing Java
to native code, has run
into the problem of implementing something in pure native code that is
completely different between platforms, or represents a significant
amount of code that ultimately isn't shared by anyone else. You either
end up with lots of ugly '#ifdef' code that is hard to read and
understand, or you duplicate the first platform's source and create
separate copies for every platform, src/solaris/*, src/windows/*, etc.
Many of these basic native code
functions are trivial when looking at one native platform, but somewhat
convoluted when dealing with multiple native platforms.&nbsp; Making
things worse, the same code is more often than not copied from one
native library to the next native library.&nbsp; This copy of native
code is error prone and increases the maintenance burden unnecessarily.<br>
<br>
In addition, certain native code libraries such as agent libraries
could benefit from sharing some basic native functionality such as:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Better memory management functionality</li>
  <li>A common native logging interface</li>
  <li>Common error handling or stderr message printing<br>
  </li>
  <li>Native UTF-8 conversion functions (e.g. UTF-8 &lt;-&gt; Platform
Encoding)</li>
  <li>Common hash table functionality<br>
  </li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
Sometimes this functionality can be obtained by calling JNI functions
or making calls into Java code, but not only is this inefficient at
times, it isn't possible for many native libraries.&nbsp; To call JNI
or Java, you need a live JVM, and many native libraries (like the JVMTI
agent libraries) need this functionality before the JVM is fully
initialized.<br>
<br>
Sometimes this functionality is provided by platform specific
libraries, but they often differ in their interfaces.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the basic functionality just doesn't exist in a way that can
be used in a MT-safe and isolated way.<br>
<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
Create a native library (libnpt.so or npt.dll) and a native interface
to that library that gives JNI and Java native code users some helpful
functionality in a clean platform neutral way. This would be kept
internal to the J2SE and it's many
native libraries.&nbsp; Exposing this library in any public way should
not be considered at this time. However, demos using it should be able
to selectively re-use some of the sources of this library, and so some
of the sources in this library will be made available in the demos for
the J2SE, but not used in the demos as a shared library.<br>
<br>
Comments are always welcome..<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Must be easily extensible, always compatible from release to
release</li>
  <li>Library must be dynamically accessable (e.g. dlopen)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Call overhead should be minimal, good performance is expected
from all these interfaces</li>
  <li>Should leverage the native platform functionality whenever
possible</li>
  <li>Code written to NPT should be platform independent, easy to dlopen<br>
  </li>
  <li>Use of NPT should be allowed from C++ or C, similar to JNI and
JVMTI
interfaces</li>
  <li>Must allow for multiple users of the library</li>
  <li>All interfaces must be MT safe</li>
  <li>All code must be compiler warning free, linted where possible,
and fully prototyped</li>
  <li>Should be easy to add another interface for sharing</li>
  <li>The debug version of the library should do full argument
consistent checking</li>
  <li>This library should only have system library dependencies, e.g.
libc</li>
  <li>These functions should NOT require a running JVM, they are pure
native code interfaces, however the jni.h typedefs and macros will be
used:<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>All functions and function pointers should use JNICALL from
jni.h for the safest calling mechanism<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Should use the basic typedefs for Java types from jni.h, where
possible<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Interface Details</h2>
The include file "npt.h" should provide some macros or inline functions
that can be used to easily get the library loaded and the interface
returned (this library loading is highly platform specific and error
prone, we need to make this easier).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The library itself should just have just two major extern interfaces
visible, something like:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JNIEXPORT void
JNICALL nptInitialize(NptEnv **pnpt, char *npt_version, char *options);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JNIEXPORT void&nbsp;&nbsp;
JNICALL&nbsp; nptTerminate(NptEnv *npt, char *options);<br>
</code><br>
But the #include file "npt.h" should also provide macros or inline
functions&nbsp; such as&nbsp; NPT_INITIALIZE() which
automatically loads the "npt" native library, get the address of
nptInitialize() in the library, and returns the NptEnv* by calling
through this pointer.&nbsp;&nbsp; All very platform specific and error
prone code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Need to experiment on this...<br>
<br>
Where options are needed, options will be provided as character
strings, this provides for maximum extensibility and compatibility. The
overhead for parsing these small strings is minimal.<br>
<code></code>
<h3>Proposed Example Usage</h3>
<code>#include "npt.h"<br>
<br>
int<br>
main(void) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nptLibrary *nptLib;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NptEnv *npt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NPT_INITIALIZE(&npt, NPT_VERSION_STRING,
start_up_options);<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if ( npt != NULL ) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int new_len;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; char output[64];<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new_len =
npt-&gt;utf8ToPlatform("some utf-8 byte array", 21, &amp;output, 64);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } else {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fprintf(stderr, "NPT
interface not available\n");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit(1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NPT_TERMINATE(npt, shutdown_options);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 0;<br>
}</code><br>
<br>
<h3>Compatibility and Extensibility</h3>
The user should never know the size of the NptEnv or any of the objects
returned by this interface (struct LogInst, struct HeapInst, etc.). The field offsets
in these structs must never change so that older code compiled to an
older interface will continue to work. The version string is a simple
"major.minor.micro" version number and the runtime version of the
library must be able to support the "major.minor" version of this
library for the initialization to be successful. This should be checked
at initialization automatically.<br>
<br>
<h3>UTF-8 Related</h3>
Here are a few possible UTF related interfaces (fields in NptEnv):<code><br>
<br>
<br>
/* UTF-8 to and from Platform encoding */<br>
int JNICALL (*utf8ToPlatform)(struct UtfInst *ui, jbyte *utf8, int len, char *output, int
outputMaxLen);<br>
int JNICALL (*utf8FromPlatform)(struct UtfInst *ui, char *str, int len, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
jbyte *output, int outputMaxLen);<br>
<br>
/* UTF-8 to Unicode, Unicode to UTF-8 Modified or Standard */<br>
int&nbsp; JNICALL (*utf8ToUtf16)(struct UtfInst *ui, jbyte *utf8, int len, jchar *output,
int outputMaxLen);<br>
int&nbsp; JNICALL (*utf16ToUtf8m)(struct UtfInst *ui, jchar *utf16, int len, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
jbyte *output, int outputMaxLen);<br>
int&nbsp; JNICALL (*utf16ToUtf8s)(struct UtfInst *ui, jchar *utf16, int len, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
jbyte *output, int outputMaxLen);<br>
<br>
/* UTF-8 Standard to UTF-8 Modified */<br>
int&nbsp; JNICALL (*utf8sToUtf8mLength)(struct UtfInst *ui, jbyte *string, int length);<br>
void JNICALL (*utf8sToUtf8m)(struct UtfInst *ui, jbyte *string, int length, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
jbyte *new_string, int new_length);<br>
<br>
/* UTF-8 Modified to UTF-8 Standard */<br>
int&nbsp; JNICALL (*utf8mToUtf8sLength)(struct UtfInst *ui, jbyte *string, int length);<br>
void JNICALL (*utf8mToUtf8s)(struct UtfInst *ui, jbyte *string, int length, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
jbyte *new_string, int new_length);</code><br>
<br>
<h3>Heap Management</h3>
One of the more dangerous parts of writing native code is the handling
of the heap, too much Java programming usually causes JNI programmers
to be sloppy :^). The use of malloc() and free(), and all it's
relations
continues to be an error prone activity, sometimes causing failures in
code that is completely unrelated to the buggy code, or causing memory
leaks that can be hard to track down.&nbsp; Performance is also an
issue with managing the memory used by the various native code
libraries.&nbsp; Performance wise, too many
malloc() calls can slow down the agent code, and sometimes slow down
the Java Virtual Machine, which could also be using malloc().&nbsp;
Providing a way to create multiple heap instances, and also do
allocations from blocks or chunks of memory, then&nbsp; specific
individual free()'s
could be replaced with a global free of the entire heap or the blocks.<br>
<br>
These are the kinds of Heap interfaces I was thinking about:<code><br>
<br>
/* Create a new heap, or delete the entire heap (managed and unmanaged)<br>
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; example HeapInitialize options:
"init=4096,incr=1024,limit=0x00ffffff,zap=yes,watch=full"<br>
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; example heapTerminate options: "verify=yes,zap=no"<br>
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; Environment variables could be used to dynamically
add to these options.<br>
&nbsp;*/<br>
</code><code>struct HeapInst* JNICALL (*heapInitialize)(char *options);</code><code></code><br>
<code>void&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JNICALL (*heapTerminate)(struct HeapInst *heap,
char *options);<br>
<br>
/* Allocate memory from a specific heap, individually managed or
unmanaged<br>
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; (Unmanaged means less overhead and tracking, you
can't realloc or <br>
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or indivdually free these pieces of memory)<br>
&nbsp;*/<br>
</code><code>const void * JNICALL (*heapAlloc)(struct HeapInst* heap, int
size);<br>
</code><code>void *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JNICALL
(*heapAllocManaged)(</code><code>struct HeapInst* heap, </code><code>int
size);<br>
</code><code>void *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JNICALL
(*heapReallocManaged)(</code><code>struct HeapInst* heap, </code><code>void
*ptr, int size);</code><code><br>
void *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JNICALL
(*heapFreeManaged)(</code><code>struct HeapInst* heap, </code><code>void *ptr);</code><br>
<br>
Often simple agent libraries only need to allocate incremental amounts
of space that is never freed until it's time to report or terminate,
using the above interfaces a single call to heapTerminate() is all that is
needed.&nbsp; Various protection code can be added internally and the
options could be used to turn on tracing or logging of the calls and
the status of the heaps.<br>
<br>
Macros could be provided for dynamic stack allocated space, e.g.
NptHeapLocalAlloc() and NptHeapLocalFree(), that could use the Solaris
alloca() when available, or use heapAllocManaged() and
heapFreeManaged() when alloca() functionality wasn't available. e.g.<br>
<br>
<code>#ifndef solaris<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #define NptHeapLocalAlloc(heap, size)&nbsp;&nbsp;
heapAllocManaged(heap, size)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #define NptHeapLocalFree(heap,
ptr)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heapFreeManaged(heap, ptr)<br>
#else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #define </code><code>NptHeapLocalAlloc(heap,
size)&nbsp;&nbsp; ((void*)alloca(size))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #define NptHeapLocalFree(heap, ptr)</code><br>
<code>#endif<br>
</code>
<h3>Native Logging</h3>
Logging events or tracing executed code in the native world is a bit
tricky. Synchronization in a pure native world is very different from
platform to platform, and every native library that has logging or
tracing sends their log to a separate file or place. There is little
consistency right now in the available logging and tracing on the
native side.&nbsp; If we could generate the standard ULF (Uniform
Logging Format) and somehow merge these logs (maybe even with the Java
logging), t seems like this would be a good thing. But we need a common
interface. And maybe the synchronization is unnecessary if we can
design the interface correctly, I'd prefer to not have any
synchronization in it.<br>
<br>
<code>struct LogInst*;<br>
<br>
/* Initialize or terminate a logging session */<br>
</code><code>struct LogInst* JNICALL (*InitializeLog)(char *options);<br>
</code><code>struct LogInst* JNICALL (*TerminateLog)(char *options);</code><br>
<code><br>
/* Uniform Logging Format Entry (ULF)<br>
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </code><code>"[#|Date&amp;Time&amp;Zone|LogLevel|ProductName|ModuleID<br>
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </code><code>|OptionalKey1=Value1;</code><code>OptionalKeyN=ValueN|MessageID:MessageText|#]\n"<br>
&nbsp;*/</code><code><br>
</code><code>struct LogInst* JNICALL (*Log)(</code><code>struct LogInst *log,
int level, const char *module,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const char *optional, const
char *messageID, const char *message);<br>
<br>
</code>This hasn't been fully thought out yet. It's possible the VM
itself could use this library. However, I don't think that's a big
issue since the VM developers always copy their libjvm.so into a j2se
install area, if libnpt is there, it should just work.<br>
<h3>Error Messages</h3>
Error messages from native code to stderr (or sometimes stdout) is
rare, but usually inconsistent. I haven't any proposal here yet, but
this seems like a potential area where we could benefit from more
consistentcy and sharing.<br>
Something I noticed with the JNI calls that start up a JavaVM is that
it has some kind of stderr/stdout re-direction option, something I
suspect is slightly broken when you consider the native libraries doing
arbitrary printf's or fprintf's to stderr.<br>
Another issue I've seen is that most classnames printed out to
stderr/stdout messages are UTF-8 bytes, yet printf/fprintf really are
expecting the default platform encoding, this seems to be an I18n issue
that could be fixed by localizing the error messages here somehow.<br>
If you add in the Modified UTF-8 vs. Standard UTF-8 complications, this
is a bit of a mess.<br>
Linux gets away with it because their default encoding is UTF-8,&nbsp;
Solaris and Windows seem like they have some problems here.<br>
The Logging messages would have the same issue here with encodings.<br>
<h3>Hash Lookup Table</h3>
Functions like hsearch(3C) on Solaris are old and not MT-safe, we sure
could use some functionality in this area.<br>
It seems like everybody has implemented their own native code hash
table logic. :^(<br>
<h3>Dictionary</h3>
Using the above Hash Lookup Table, we could create a shared dictionary
mechanism.<br>
I know it's hard to get a bunch of engineers to agree on the interface,
but I'd rather re-use something like this than spend months getting it
right and then maintaining all the code.<br>
<br>
<h3>Platform Specific</h3>
Things like getting the current directory, definitions of 'errno', etc.<br>
<br>
Just browsing the src/windows and src/solaris directory trees in the
J2SE workspace should yield a long list of functions that needed to be
completely different between Windows and Solaris, and you will likely
find multiple copies of the same basic coding.<br>
