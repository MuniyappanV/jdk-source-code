 * This class provides a binding between a Signature object and an

 * is needed in many public key signing applications.
 *
 * <P>The name of the signer is important, both because knowing it is the
 * whole point of the signature, and because the associated X.509 certificate
 * is always used to verify the signature.
 *
 * <P><em>The X.509 certificate chain is temporarily not associated with
 * the signer, but this omission will be resolved.</em>
