/* rwb 4/2/90  New definition of sc_BitMapData.

bitMap is high bits tall, and wide bits wide, but wide is rounded up to
a long.  The actual gxBitmap width is xMax - xMin. xMin and yMin represent the
rounded integer value of the minimum 26.6 coordinate, but j.5 is rounded down
to j rather than up to j+1.  xMax and yMax represent the rounded up integer
value of the maximum 26.6 coordinat, and j.5 does round up to j+1.  The actual
pixel center scan lines that are represented in the gxBitmap are xMin ... xMax-1
and yMin...to ...yMax-1.

nYchanges is the total number of times that all of the contours in a glyph changed
y direction.  It is always an even number, and represents the maximum number
of times that a row scan gxLine can intersect the glyph.  Similarly, nXchanges
is the total number of x direction changes.

yLines is an array of arrays.  Each array corresoponds to one row scan gxLine.  Each
array is nYchanges+2 entries long. The 0th entry contains the number of times that row 
intersects the glyph contours in an On Transition and then the pixel columns where
the intersections occur.  These intersections are sorted from left to right.  The last
entry contains the number of OFF transition intersections, and the immediately
preceding entries contain the pixel column numbers where the intersections occur.
These are also sorted from left to right.  yBase is an array of
pointers; each pointer pointing to one of the arrays in yLines.

Similarly, xLines and xBase describe the intersection of column scan lines with
the glyph conotours.  These arrays are only used to fix dropouts.
