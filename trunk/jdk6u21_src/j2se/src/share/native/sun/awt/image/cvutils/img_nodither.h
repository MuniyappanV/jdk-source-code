/*
 * This file contains macro definitions for the Encoding category of
 * the macros used by the generic scaleloop function.
 *
 * This implementation performs no encoding of output pixels at all
 * and is only useful for output pixel formats which consist of 3
 * bytes per pixel containing the red, green and blue components.
 * Since the components are stored explicitly in their own memory
 * accesses, they do not need to be encoded into a single monolithic
 * pixel first.  The value of the "pixel" variable will be undefined
 * during the output stage of the generic scale loop if this file
 * is used.
