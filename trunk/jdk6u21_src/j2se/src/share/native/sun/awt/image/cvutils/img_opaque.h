 * This file contains macro definitions for the Alpha category of the

 * This implementation of the Alpha macros will ignore all alpha
 * information.  It also provides an empty expansion of the IfAlpha
 * macro which keeps the other macro sets in the image package from
 * wasting time and space on code to fetch or store the alpha
 * information.  This file is only applicable when the incoming
 * data is known to be entirely opaque and there is not yet any
 * image mask or alpha buffer associated with the output data.
