<a name="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<blockquote>
Thank you for downloading this release of the 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Platform, Standard Edition for Business Development Kit 
(JDK<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> FB).
This JDK FB is based on the 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Platform Standard Edition
Development Kit 6 (JDK 6).
As such, its bundled documentation is that of the JDK 6.
<p>
The JDK FB is a development environment for building applications, 
applets, and components using the Java programming language.  
<p>
The JDK FB includes tools useful for developing and 
testing programs written in the Java programming language and running on 
the Java platform. These tools are designed to be used from the command 
line. Except for the appletviewer, these tools do not provide a graphical user
interface.

<p>
<a name="install"><h2>System Requirements & Installation</h2></a>
<blockquote>
System requirements, installation instructions and troubleshooting
tips are located on the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javaseforbusiness/">
Java SE for Business Portal
</a>.
</blockquote>

<a name="docs"><h2>JDK FB Documentation</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The on-line <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/index.html">Java Platform Standard Edition Documentation</a> 
contains API specifications, feature descriptions, developer guides, 
reference pages for JDK tools and utilities, 
demos, and links to related information.  This documentation is also 
available in a download bundle which you can install on your machine.  
For API documentation, refer to the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html">The Java Platform Standard Edition API Specification</a>
This provides brief descriptions of the API with
an emphasis on specifications, not on code examples.

</ul>

<p>
<a name=relnotes><h2>Release Notes</h2></a>
<blockquote>
See the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javaseforbusiness/">
Java SE for Business Portal
</a>
for additional  information pertaining to this release.
The on-line release notes will be updated as needed, so you should check 
them occasionally for the latest information.
</blockquote>

<a name=compatibility><h2>Compatibility</h2></a>
<blockquote>

<p>
See <a href=http://java.sun.com/javase/6/compatibility.html>
Compatibility with Previous Releases</a> on the Java Software web site 
for the list of known compatibility issues. Every effort has been made to 
support programs written for previous versions of the Java platform. 
Although some 
incompatible changes were necessary, most software should migrate to 
the current version with no reprogramming.  Any failure to do so is 
considered a bug, except for a small number of cases where compatibility 
was deliberately broken, as described on our compatibility web page. Some
compatibility-breaking changes were required to close potential
security holes or to fix implementation or design bugs.
</blockquote>

<a name=bugs><h2>Bug Reports and Feedback</h2>
<blockquote>
The  
<a href=http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/>Bug Parade
Web Page</a> on the Java Developer Connection web site lets you search
for and examine existing bug reports, 
submit your own bug reports, and tell us which bug fixes matter most 
to you.  To directly submit a bug or request a feature, fill out this 
form:
<blockquote>
  <code><a href="http://java.sun.com/webapps/bugreport">
  http://java.sun.com/webapps/bugreport</a></code>
</blockquote>
You can send feedback on JDK documentation to the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/forms/sendusmail.html">Java documentation team</a>.
You can also send comments directly to 
<a href=http://java.sun.com/mail/>Java Software engineering team 
email addresses</a>. 
<p>
<b>Note</b> - You should not seek technical support from Bug Parade or our
development teams. For support options, see the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javaseforbusiness/">
Java SE for Business Portal</a>.

<a name=contents><h2>Contents of the JDK FB</h2></a>
<blockquote>
This section contains a general summary of the files and directories in
the JDK. For details on the files and directories, see
<a href=http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/tooldocs/index.html>JDK File Structure</a> portion of the Java SE documentation.

<dl>
    <dt><b>Development Tools</b>
	<dd>(In the <code>bin</code> subdirectory.) Tools and utilities 
        that will
	help you develop, execute, debug, and document programs written
	in the Java programming language. For further information, see
	the <a href=http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/tooldocs/index.html>tool         documentation</a>.

    <p>
        <dt><b>Runtime Environment</b>
	<dd>(In the <code>jre</code> subdirectory.)
	An implementation of the Java SE runtime environment for use by 
        the JDK. The runtime environment includes a Java
	virtual machine, class libraries, and other files that support 
        the execution of programs written in the
	Java programming language.
    <p>
        <dt><b>Additional Libraries</b>
	<dd>(In the <code>lib</code> subdirectory.) Additional class
	libraries and support files required by the development tools.
    <p>
        <dt><b>Demo Applets and Applications</b>
	<dd>(In the <code>demo</code> subdirectory.) Examples, with
	source code, of programming for the Java platform. These
	include examples that use Swing and other Java Foundation
	Classes, and the Java Platform Debugger Architecture.
    <p>
        <dt><b>C header Files</b>
	<dd>(In the <code>include</code> subdirectory.) Header
	files that support native-code programming using the
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jni/index.html">Java Native Interface</a>, the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jvmti/index.html">JVM<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Tool Interface</a>,
        and other functionality of the Java Platform.

    <p>
        <dt><b>Source Code</b>
	<dd>(In <code>src.zip</code>.) Java programming 
        language source files for all classes that make up the Java&nbsp; 
        core API
        (that is, source files for the java.*, javax.* and some org.* 
        packages, but not for com.sun.* packages). 
        This source code is provided for informational purposes 
        only, to help developers learn and use the Java programming
        language. These files do not include platform-specific 
        implementation code and cannot be used to rebuild the 
        class libraries.  To extract these files, use any common zip 
        utility.  Or, you may use the Jar utility in the JDK's 
        <tt>bin</tt> directory:
<pre>
    jar xvf src.zip
</pre>
	</ul>
</ul>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<a name=jre>
<h2>Java SE for Business Runtime Environment (JRE<sup><fontsize=-2>TM</fontsize></sup> FB)
</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The Java SE for Business Runtime Environment 
(JRE<sup><fontsize=-2>TM</fontsize></sup> FB)
is available as a separately downloadable product.  See the 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javaseforbusiness/">
download web site</a>.
<p>
The JRE FB allows you to run applications written in the Java programming language.  
Like the JDK FB, it contains the Java virtual machine, classes comprising the Java Platform API, 
and supporting files. Unlike the JDK FB, it does not contain development tools 
such as compilers and debuggers. 
<p>
All distributions of the JRE FB with your Programs are subject
to the terms of the JRE FB Software License Agreement.
<p>
Once Licensed Solution Providers have developed an application
using the JDK FB, they can ship it with the JRE FB so their
end-users can have a Java SE for Business platform on which
to run their software.

<h2><a name="endorsed"</a>Java Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism</h2>

<blockquote>
From time to time it is necessary to update the Java platform in order to
incorporate newer versions of standards that are created outside of the
<a href="http://www.jcp.org/">Java Community Process<font size="-2"><sup>SM</sup></font></a> 
(JCP<font size="-2"><sup>SM</sup></font>) 
(<i>Endorsed Standards</i>), or in order to update the version of a technology 
included in the platform to correspond to a later standalone version of that
technology (<i>Standalone Technologies</i>).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The <i>Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism</i> provides a means whereby
later versions of classes and interfaces that implement Endorsed Standards
or Standalone Technologies may be incorporated into the Java Platform.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
For more information on the Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism,
including the list of platform packages that it may be used to override, see:
