/** 
 * This class creates sockets.  It may be subclassed by other factories,
 * which create particular subclasses of sockets and thus provide a general
 * framework for the addition of public socket-level functionality.
 *
 * <P> Socket factories are a simple way to capture a variety of policies
 * related to the sockets being constructed, producing such sockets in
 * a way which does not require special configuration of the code which
 * asks for the sockets:  <UL>
 *
 *	<LI> Due to polymorphism of both factories and sockets, different
 *	kinds of sockets can be used by the same application code just
 *	by passing it different kinds of factories.
 *
 *	<LI> Factories can themselves be customized with parameters used
 *	in socket construction.  So for example, factories could be
 *	customized to return sockets with different networking timeouts
 *      or security parameters already configured.
 *
 *	<LI> The sockets returned to the application can be subclasses
 *	of java.net.Socket, so that they can directly expose new APIs
 *	for features such as compression, security, record marking,
 *	statistics collection, or firewall tunneling.
 *
 *	</UL>
 *
 * <P> Factory classes are specified by environment-specific configuration
 * mechanisms.  For example, the <em>getDefault</em> method could return
 * a factory that was appropriate for a particular user or applet, and a
 * framework could use a factory customized to its own purposes.
