Provides interfaces for Diffie-Hellman keys as defined in
RSA Laboratories' PKCS #3.
<P>
Note that these interfaces are intended only
for key implementations whose key material
is accessible and available. These
interfaces are not intended for key
implementations whose key material resides
in inaccessible, protected storage (such as
in a hardware device).
<P>
For more developer information on how to use
these interfaces, including information on
how to design <code>Key</code> classes
for hardware devices, please refer to the
cryptographic provider developer guide:
