/** 
 * This class provides the functionality of a cryptographic cipher for
 * encryption and decryption. It forms the core of the Java Cryptographic
 * Extension (JCE) framework.
 *
 * <p>In order to create a Cipher object, the application calls the
 * Cipher's <code>getInstance</code> method, and passes the name of the
 * requested <i>transformation</i> to it. Optionally, the name of a provider
 * may be specified.
 *
 * <p>A <i>transformation</i> is a string that describes the operation (or
 * set of operations) to be performed on the given input, to produce some
 * output. A transformation always includes the name of a cryptographic
 * algorithm (e.g., <i>DES</i>), and may be followed by a feedback mode and
 * padding scheme.
 *
 * <p> A transformation is of the form:<p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>"<i>algorithm/mode/padding</i>" or
 * <p>
 * <li>"<i>algorithm</i>"
 * </ul>
 *
 * <P> (in the latter case,
 * provider-specific default values for the mode and padding scheme are used).
 * For example, the following is a valid transformation:<p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance("<i>DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding</i>");
 * </pre>
 *
 * Using modes such as <code>CFB</code> and <code>OFB<code>, block
 * ciphers can encrypt data in units smaller than the cipher's actual
 * block size.  When requesting such a mode, you may optionally specify
 * the number of bits to be processed at a time by appending this number
 * to the mode name as shown in the "<code>DES/CFB8/NoPadding</code>" and
 * "<code>DES/OFB32/PKCS5Padding</code>" transformations. If no such
 * number is specified, a provider-specific default is used. (For
 * example, the SunJCE provider uses a default of 64 bits for DES.)
 * Thus, block ciphers can be turned into byte-oriented stream ciphers by
 * using an 8 bit mode such as CFB8 or OFB8.
