             Java(TM) Platform, Standard Edition for Business
                        Runtime Environment
                             Version 6


The Java(TM) Platform, Standard Edition for Business Runtime Environment
(JRE(TM) FB), excluding the JavaFX(TM) runtime, contains the Java virtual 
machine, runtime class libraries, and Java application launcher that are 
necessary to run programs written in the Java programming language. It is
not a development environment and does not contain development tools such
as compilers or debuggers. For development tools, see the Java SE 
Development Kit for Business(JDK(TM) FB).

All distributions of the JRE FB with your Programs are subject to the terms 
of the JRE FB Software License Agreement.

Once Licensed Solution Providers have developed an application using the 
JDK FB, they can ship it with the JRE FB so their end-users can have a 
Java SE for Business platform on which to run their software.
