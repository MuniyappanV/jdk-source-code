After making any changes to libproc.so, the shell scripts described
below can be run to verify that it does not break Java Serviceability
Agent.

Setup:

You need to have jdk 1.5 installed to run this test. Set environment
variable SA_JAVA to point to the java executable of jdk
1.5. Otherwise, the script picks-up 'java' from PATH.

Running the tests:

run libproctest.sh (32-bit debuggee) and libproctest64.sh (64-bit
debuggee)

Interpreting result:

"PASSED" or "FAILED" is printed in standard output.
