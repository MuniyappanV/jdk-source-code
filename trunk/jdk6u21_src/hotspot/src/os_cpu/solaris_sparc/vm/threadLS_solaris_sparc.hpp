    // "thread" structure.  On T1 the thread structure is allocated on the
    // user's stack (yes, really!) so the ">>20" handles T1 where the JVM's
    // stack size is usually >= 1Mb.  The ">>9" is for T2 where Roger allocates
    // globs of thread blocks contiguously.  The "9" has to do with the
    // expected size of the T2 thread structure.  If these constants are wrong
    // the worst thing that'll happen is that the hit rate for heavily threaded
    // apps won't be as good as it could be.  If you want to burn another
    // shift+xor you could mix together _all of the %g7 bits to form the hash,
    // but I think that's excessive.  Making the change above changed the
    // T$ miss rate on SpecJBB (on a 16X system) from about 3% to imperceptible.
