# NewLatest
#
# Determining the correct algorithm to apply for setting the "latest"
# link isn't as obvious as it might seem. The complication is due to
# package removal.  If the "latest" is being removed, you want to set
# the "latest" link to something else.  The trouble is, if that something
# else wasn't put there via pkgadd (a tar ball for example) or simply
# predates the creation of this interface, absolutely nothing will
# happen on that removal and the link will be left dangling.
#
# There is no complete solution for this, but following algorithm
# limits the problem area to systems where some installs happened
# via packages and other installs by tar archives - in other words,
# an edge condition in a rare scenario.
#
# On installation:
#
#	if <"latest" doesn't exist, or points to something older> then
#		set latest to point at the instance being installed
#
# On removal:
#
#	scan the registry for the most recent of the remaining JVMs
#	if <the most recent remaining is >= 1.5.0_01> then
#		set the link to point to the most recent remaining
#	else
#		remove the link
#	fi
#
# 1.5.0_01 is significant, because that is the first jvm which will
# manipulate this link, and hence, won't leave it dangling should it
# be removed.  The algorithm could be modified to carry back as far
# as 1.4.2_05, with the only downside being the potential for dangling
# links.  Carrying it back beyond this would be a nightmare, because
# a not-so-obvious part of the semantic of "latest", is that it is
# Multiple JRE enabled.
