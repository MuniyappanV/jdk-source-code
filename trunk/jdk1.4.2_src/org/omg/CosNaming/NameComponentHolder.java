/** 
   * Many of the operations defined on a naming context take names as
   * parameters. Names have structure. A name is an ordered sequence of 
   * components. <p>
   * 
   * A name with a single component is called a simple name; a name with
   * multiple components is called a compound name. Each component except 
   * the last is used to name a context; the last component denotes the 
   * bound object. <p>
   * 
   * A name component consists of two attributes: the identifier
   * attribute and the kind attribute. Both the identifier attribute and the 
   * kind attribute are represented as IDL strings. The kind attribute adds 
   * descriptive power to names in a syntax-independent way. Examples of the 
   * value of the kind attribute include c_source, object_code, executable, 
   * postscript, or " ".
