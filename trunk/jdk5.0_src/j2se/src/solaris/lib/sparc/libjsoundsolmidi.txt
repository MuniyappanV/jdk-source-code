The files

  libjsoundsolmidi.so
  libjsoundsolmidi_g.so

are the JNI wrappers to access the Solaris MIDI library from Java Sound.
Since the Solaris MIDI package is not yet publicly available,
it is not built by default. Rather, it is copied from this 
directory to the output directory when Java Sound is built.

In order to compile the JNI wrapper, define 

	BUILD_SOLARISMIDI=true

and run a clean build of the Java Sound area on a machine that 
has the Solaris MIDI package installed.
