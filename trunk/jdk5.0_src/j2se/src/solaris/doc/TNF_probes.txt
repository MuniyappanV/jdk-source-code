prog_start	program started			-			src/solaris/bin/java.c
prog_end	program exiting			long:exit_status	src/solaris/bin/java.c
prog_end	program exiting via sysExit	long:exit_status	src/solaris/java/runtime/system_md.c

These time the entry and exit to main(), and the call to exit().  
Unfortunately, there are direct calls to exit() elsewhere in the
code.  Sigh.


JVM_start	JVM started			-			src/solaris/java/javai/javai.c

java_main() called.


JIT_start	start JIT compilation		-			src/jit/share/JIT.c
JIT_end		exiting JIT compilation		long:NOT_COMPILABLE	src/jit/share/JIT.c
						long:code_length
						long:CompiledCodeLength

These time each compilation, recording the # of bytecodes input and #
bytes of compiled code output.


GC_start	starting GC			-			src/share/java/runtime/gcimpl.c
GC_end		ending GC			-			src/share/java/runtime/gcimpl.c

These measure time to run GC.


GC_suspend_start	suspending threads for GC	long:ActiveThreadCount	src/share/java/runtime/gcimpl.c
GC_suspend_end		threads suspended for GC	-			src/share/java/runtime/gcimpl.c

GC_resume_start		resuming threads after GC	long:ActiveThreadCount	src/share/java/runtime/gcimpl.c
GC_resume_end		threads resumed after GC	-			src/share/java/runtime/gcimpl.c

These measure the time it takes to suspend and resume threads prior to
starting and after finishing GC (and how many threads).

GC_safepoint_start	advancing threads to safe points -			src/share/java/runtime/gcimpl.c
GC_safepoint_end	threads advanced to safe points -			src/share/java/runtime/gcimpl.c

These measure how long it takes to advance threads to safe points
prior to GC.
