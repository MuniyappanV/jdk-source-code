Provides the classes and interfaces for cryptographic operations. The
cryptographic operations defined in this package include encryption,
key generation and key agreement, and Message Authentication Code
(MAC) generation.

<p>Support for encryption includes symmetric, asymmetric, block, and
stream ciphers. This package also supports secure streams and sealed
objects.

<p>Many of the classes provided in this package are provider-based.  The
class itself defines a programming interface to which applications may
write.  The implementations themselves may then be written by
independent third-party vendors and plugged in seamlessly as needed.
Therefore application developers may take advantage of any number of
provider-based implementations without having to add or rewrite code.
