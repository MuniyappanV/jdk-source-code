                          WWW: http://www.cups.org


INTRODUCTION

The Common UNIX Printing System(tm), ("CUPS(tm)"), is provided
under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") and GNU Library
General Public License ("LGPL"), Version 2, with exceptions for
Apple operating systems and the OpenSSL toolkit. A copy of the
exceptions and licenses follow this introduction.

The GNU LGPL applies to the CUPS API library, located in the
"cups" subdirectory of the CUPS source distribution and in the
"cups" include directory and library files in the binary
distributions. The GNU GPL applies to the remainder of the CUPS
distribution, including the "pdftops" filter which is based upon
Xpdf and the CUPS imaging library.

For those not familiar with the GNU GPL, the license basically
allows you to:

   - Use the CUPS software at no charge.
   - Distribute verbatim copies of the software in source or
     binary form.
   - Sell verbatim copies of the software for a media fee, or
     sell support for the software.
   - Distribute or sell printer drivers and filters that use
     CUPS so long as source code is made available under the
     GPL.

What this license *does not* allow you to do is make changes or
add features to CUPS and then sell a binary distribution without
source code. You must provide source for any new drivers,
changes, or additions to the software, and all code must be
provided under the GPL or LGPL as appropriate. The only
exceptions to this are the portions of the CUPS software covered
by the Apple operating system license exceptions outlined later
in this license agreement.

The GNU LGPL relaxes the "link-to" restriction, allowing you to
develop applications that use the CUPS API library under other
licenses and/or conditions as appropriate for your application.


LICENSE EXCEPTIONS

In addition, as the copyright holder of CUPS, Easy Software
Products grants the following special exceptions:

     1. Apple Operating System Development License Exception;

        a. Software that is developed by any person or entity
           for an Apple Operating System ("Apple OS-Developed
           Software"), including but not limited to Apple and
           third party printer drivers, filters, and backends
           for an Apple Operating System, that is linked to the
           CUPS imaging library or based on any sample filters
           or backends provided with CUPS shall not be
           considered to be a derivative work or collective work
           based on the CUPS program and is exempt from the
           mandatory source code release clauses of the GNU GPL.
           You may therefore distribute linked combinations of
           the CUPS imaging library with Apple OS-Developed
           Software without releasing the source code of the
           Apple OS-Developed Software. You may also use sample
           filters and backends provided with CUPS to develop
           Apple OS-Developed Software without releasing the
           source code of the Apple OS-Developed Software.

        b. An Apple Operating System means any operating system
           software developed and/or marketed by Apple Computer,
           Inc., including but not limited to all existing
           releases and versions of Apple's Darwin, Mac OS X,
           and Mac OS X Server products and all follow-on
           releases and future versions thereof.

        c. This exception is only available for Apple
           OS-Developed Software and does not apply to software
           that is distributed for use on other operating
           systems.

        d. All CUPS software that falls under this license
           exception have the following text at the top of each
           source file:

             This file is subject to the Apple OS-Developed
             Software exception.

     2. OpenSSL Toolkit License Exception;

        a. Easy Software Products explicitly allows the
           compilation and distribution of the CUPS software
           with the OpenSSL Toolkit.

No developer is required to provide these exceptions in a
derived work.


TRADEMARKS

Easy Software Products has trademarked the Common UNIX Printing
System, CUPS, and CUPS logo. These names and logos may be used
freely in any direct port or binary distribution of CUPS. Please
contract Easy Software Products for written permission to use
them in derivative products. Our intention is to protect the
value of these trademarks and ensure that any derivative product
meets the same high-quality standards as the original.


BINARY DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS

Easy Software Products also sells rights to the CUPS source code
under a binary distribution license for vendors that are unable
to release source code for their drivers, additions, and
modifications to CUPS under the GNU GPL and LGPL. For
information please contact us at the address shown above.

The Common UNIX Printing System provides a "pdftops" filter that
is based on the Xpdf software. For binary distribution licensing
of this software, please contact:

     Email: derekn@foolabs.com
     WWW: http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/


SUPPORT

Easy Software Products sells software support for CUPS as well
as a commercial printing product based on CUPS called ESP Print
Pro. You can find out more at our web site:

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent

U) The following software may be included in this product: SAX v. 2.0.1; Use of any of this software is governed by the terms of the license below: 
Copyright Status

                         SAX is free!

                         In fact, it's not possible to own a license to SAX, 
since it's been placed in the public
                         domain. 

                         No Warranty

                         Because SAX is released to the public domain, there is 
no warranty for the design or for
                         the software implementation, to the extent permitted by 
applicable law. Except when
                         otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders 
and/or other parties provide SAX "as is"
                         without warranty of any kind, either expressed or 
implied, including, but not limited to, the
                         implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a 
particular purpose. The entire risk as
                         to the quality and performance of SAX is with you. 
Should SAX prove defective, you
                         assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or 
correction.

                         In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed 
to in writing will any copyright
                         holder, or any other party who may modify and/or 
redistribute SAX, be liable to you for
                         damages, including any general, special, incidental or 
consequential damages arising out of
                         the use or inability to use SAX (including but not 
limited to loss of data or data being
                         rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third 
parties or a failure of the SAX to
                         operate with any other programs), even if such holder 
or other party has been advised of
                         the possibility of such damages.

                         Copyright Disclaimers

collectively by the membership of
                         the XML-DEV mailing list, is hereby released into the 
public domain.

                         No one owns SAX: you may use it freely in both 
commercial and non-commercial
                         applications, bundle it with your software 
distribution, include it on a CD-ROM, list the
                         source code in a book, mirror the documentation at your 
own web site, or use it in any
                         other way you see fit.

                         SAX 2.0 

                         I hereby abandon any property rights to SAX 2.0 (the 
Simple API for XML), and release
                         all of the SAX 2.0 source code, compiled code, and
