/**
 * The Lock class provides a simple, useful interface to a lock.
 * Unlike monitors which synchronize access to an object, locks
 * synchronize access to an arbitrary set of resources (objects,
 * methods, variables, etc.). <p>
 *
 * The programmer using locks must be responsible for clearly defining
 * the semantics of their use and should handle deadlock avoidance in
 * the face of exceptions. <p>
 *
 * For example, if you want to protect a set of method invocations with
 * a lock, and one of the methods may throw an exception, you must be
 * prepared to release the lock similarly to the following example:
 * <pre>
 *	class SomeClass {
 *	    Lock myLock = new Lock();

 *	    void someMethod() {
 *	        myLock.lock();
 *		try {
 *	    	    StartOperation();
 *		    ContinueOperation();
 *		    EndOperation();
 *		} finally {
 *	    	    myLock.unlock();
 *		}
 *	    }
 *	}
 * </pre>
