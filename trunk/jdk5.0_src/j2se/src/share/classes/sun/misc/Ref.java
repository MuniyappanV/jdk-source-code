/**
 * A "Ref" is an indirect reference to an object that the garbage collector
 * knows about.  An application should override the reconstitute() method with one
 * that will construct the object based on information in the Ref, often by
 * reading from a file.  The get() method retains a cache of the result of the last call to
 * reconstitute() in the Ref.  When space gets tight, the garbage collector
 * will clear old Ref cache entries when there are no other pointers to the
 * object.  In normal usage, Ref will always be subclassed.  The subclass will add the 
 * instance variables necessary for the reconstitute() method to work.  It will also add a 
 * constructor to set them up, and write a version of reconstitute().
