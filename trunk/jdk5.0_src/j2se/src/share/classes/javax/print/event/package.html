Package javax.print.event contains event classes  and listener interfaces.
<p>
They may be used to monitor both print services (such as printers going
on-line & off-line), and the progress of a specific print job.
<P>
Please note: In the javax.print APIs, a null reference parameter to methods 
is incorrect unless explicitly documented on the method as having a meaningful
interpretation. Usage to the contrary is incorrect coding and may result
in a run time exception either immediately or at some later time.
IllegalArgumentException and NullPointerException are examples of
typical and acceptable run time exceptions for such cases.
<P>
@since 1.4
