      <p>Provides the definition of the monitor classes.  A Monitor is
      an MBean that periodically observes the value of an attribute in
      one or more other MBeans.  If the attribute meets a certain
      condition, the Monitor emits a {@link
      javax.management.monitor.MonitorNotification
      MonitorNotification}.</p>

      <p>The exact behavior of monitors is detailed in the
	<a href="#spec">JMX Specification</a>.  What follows is a
	summary.</p>

      <p>There are three kinds of Monitors:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>

	  <p>A {@link javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor
	    CounterMonitor} observes attributes of integer
	    type.  The attributes are assumed to be non-negative, and
	    monotonically increasing except for a possible
	    <em>roll-over</em> at a specified <em>modulus</em>.  Each
	    observed attribute has an associated <em>threshold</em>
	    value.  A notification is sent when the attribute exceeds
	    its threshold.</p>
	  
	  <p>An <em>offset</em> value can be specified.  When an
	    observed value exceeds its threshold, the threshold is
	    incremented by the offset, or by a multiple of the offset
	    sufficient to make the threshold greater than the new
	    observed value.</p>

	  <p>A <code>CounterMonitor</code> can operate in
	    <em>difference mode</em>.  In this mode, the value
	    compared against the threshold is the difference between
	    two successive observations of an attribute.</p>
	  
	</li>
	<li>

	  <p>A {@link javax.management.monitor.GaugeMonitor
	    GaugeMonitor} observes attributes of numerical type.  Each
	    observed attribute has an associated <em>high
	      threshold</em> and <em>low threshold</em>.</p>

	  <p>When an observed attribute crosses the high threshold, if
	    the <em>notify high</em> flag is true, then a notification
	    is sent.  Subsequent crossings of the high threshold value
	    will not trigger further notifications until the gauge value
	    becomes less than or equal to the low threshold.</p>

	  <p>When an observed attribute crosses the low threshold, if
	    the <em>notify low</em> flag is true, then a notification
	    is sent.  Subsequent crossings of the low threshold value
	    will not trigger further notifications until the gauge
	    value becomes greater than or equal to the high
	    threshold.</p>

	  <p>Typically, only one of the notify high and notify low
	    flags is set.  The other threshold is used to provide a
	    <em>hysteresis</em> mechanism to avoid the repeated
	    triggering of notifications when an attribute makes small
	    oscillations around the threshold value.</p>

	  <p>A <code>GaugeMonitor</code> can operate in <em>difference
	      mode</em>.  In this mode, the value compared against the
	    high and low thresholds is the difference between two
	    successive observations of an attribute.</p>

	</li>
	<li>

	  <p>A {@link javax.management.monitor.StringMonitor
	    StringMonitor} observes attributes of type
	    <code>String</code>.  A notification is sent when an
	    observed attribute becomes equal and/or not equal to a
	    given string.</p>

	</li>
      </ul>
