      <p>Interfaces for remote access to
	JMX MBean servers.
	This package defines the essential interfaces for making a JMX
	MBean server manageable remotely.  The companion document 
        <em>JMX Remote API</em> completes the specification of this 
        interface.  It should be available as a PDF document in the
        same place as this Javadoc specification.</p>

      <p>The JMX specification defines the notion of <b>connectors</b>.
	A connector is attached to a JMX API MBean server and makes it
	accessible to remote Java clients. The client end of a
	connector exports essentially the same interface as the MBean
	server, specifically the {@link
	javax.management.MBeanServerConnection MBeanServerConnection}
	interface.</p>

      <p>A connector makes an MBean server remotely accessible through
	a given protocol. 
      <br>The JMX Remote API defines a standard connector,
	the <b>RMI Connector</b>, which provides remote access to an
        MBeanServer through RMI.
      <br>The JMX Remote API also defines an optional protocol called 
        <b>JMXMP</b> (JMX Message Protocol).  JMXMP is
	based on serialized Java objects (defined in the optional package
	{@link javax.management.remote.message}) over a TCP
	connection.  The connector that implements this protocol is
	called the <b>JMXMP Connector</b>.  User-defined connector
	protocols are also possible using the {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorFactory
	JMXConnectorFactory} and, optionally, the Generic Connector
	({@link javax.management.remote.generic}).</p>

      <h3>Connector addresses</h3>

      <p>Typically, a connector has an address, represented by the
	class {@link javax.management.remote.JMXServiceURL
	JMXServiceURL}.  An address for the JMXMP Connector looks
	like this:</p>

      <pre>
      service:jmx:jmxmp://myhost:9876
      </pre>

      <p>An address for the RMI Connector can take several forms,
	as detailed in the documentation for the package
	<code>javax.management.remote.rmi</code>.</p>

      <h3>Creating a connector server</h3>

      <p>A connector server is created by constructing an instance of
	a subclass of {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorServer
	JMXConnectorServer}.  Usually, this instance is created
        using the method {@link
        javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorServerFactory#newJMXConnectorServer(JMXServiceURL,
        java.util.Map, javax.management.MBeanServer)
	JMXConnectorServerFactory.newJMXConnectorServer}.</p>

      <p>Typically, a connector server is associated with an MBean
	server either by registering it in that MBean server, or by
	supplying the MBean server as a parameter when creating the
	connector server.</p>

      <h3>Creating a connector client</h3>

      <p>A connector client is usually created by supplying a
	<code>JMXServiceURL</code> to the {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorFactory#connect(JMXServiceURL)
	JMXConnectorFactory.connect} method.</p>

      <p>For more specialized uses, a connector client can be created
	by directly instantiating a class that implements the {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnector JMXConnector} interface,
	for example the class {@link
	javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIConnector
	RMIConnector}.</p>

      <h3>Additional client or server parameters</h3>

      <p>When creating a connector client or server, it is possible to
	supply an object of type {@link java.util.Map Map} that defines
	additional parameters.  Each entry in this Map has a key that is
	a string and an associated value whose type is appropriate for
	that key.  The standard keys defined by the JMX Remote API all
	begin with the string "<code>jmx.remote.</code>".  The document
	<em>JMX Remote API</em> lists these standard keys.</p>

      <h3>Connection identifiers</h3>

      <p>Every connection opened by a connector server has a string
	identifier, called its <b>connection id</b>.  This identifier
	appears in the {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnectionNotification
	JMXConnectionNotification} events emitted by the connector
	server, in the list returned by {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorServerMBean#getConnectionIds()
	JMXConnectorServerMBean#getConnectionIds()}, and in the value
	returned by the client's {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnector#getConnectionId()
	getConnectionId()} method.</p>

      <p>Conventionally, a connection ID looks something like this:</p>

      <pre>
jmxmp://clienthost:6789 clientname xxxyyyzzz
      </pre>

      <p>The formal grammar for connection ids that follow this
	convention is as follows (using the <a
	href="http://webmirror.sfbay.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/grammars.doc.html#90767">grammar
	notation</a> from <em>The Java Language Specification, Second
	Edition</em>):</p>

      <pre>
<em>ConnectionId:</em>
    <em>Protocol</em> : <em>ClientAddress<sub>opt</sub></em> Space <em>ClientId<sub>opt</sub></em> Space <em>ArbitraryText</em>

<em>ClientAddress:</em>
    // <em>HostAddress</em> <em>ClientPort<sub>opt</sub></em>

<em>ClientPort</em>
    : <em>HostPort</em>
      </pre>

      <p>The <code><em>Protocol</em></code> is a protocol that would
	be recognized by {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorFactory
	JMXConnectorFactory}.</p>

      <p>The <code><em>ClientAddress</em></code> is the
	address and port of the connecting client, if these can be
	determined, otherwise nothing.  The
	<code><em>HostAddress</em></code> is the Internet address of
	the host that the client is connecting from, in numeric or DNS
	form.  Numeric IPv6 addresses are enclosed in square brackets
	<code>[]</code>.  The <code><em>HostPort</em></code> is the
	decimal port number that the client is connecting from.</p>

      <p>The <code><em>ClientId</em></code> is the identity of the
	client entity, typically a string returned by {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXPrincipal#getName()
	JMXPrincipal.getName()}.  This string must not contain
	spaces.</p>

      <p>The <code><em>ArbitraryText</em></code> is any additional
	text that the connector server adds when creating the client id.
	At a minimum, it must be enough to distinguish this connection
	ID from the ID of any other connection currently opened by this
	connector server.</p>
