      <p>Provides the definition of the Timer MBean.  A Timer MBean
      maintains a list of scheduled notifications and, because it is a
      {@link javax.management.NotificationBroadcaster
      NotificationBroadcaster}, a list of listeners for those
      notifications.  Whenever the time for one of the scheduled
      notifications is reached, each listener receives the
      notification.  Notifications can be repeated at a fixed
      interval, and the number of repetitions can be bounded.</p>

      <p>A listener for a Timer MBean can itself be an MBean, using
      the method {@link
      javax.management.MBeanServer#addNotificationListener(ObjectName,
      ObjectName, NotificationFilter, Object)}.  In this way, a
      management application can create an MBean representing a task,
      then schedule that task using a Timer MBean.</p>
