/**
 * <p>Provides an implementation of {@link
 * javax.management.NotificationEmitter NotificationEmitter}
 * interface.  This can be used as the super class of an MBean that
 * sends notifications.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is not specified whether the notification dispatch model is
 * synchronous or asynchronous.  That is, when a thread calls {@link
 * #sendNotification sendNotification}, the {@link
 * NotificationListener#handleNotification
 * NotificationListener.handleNotification} method of each listener
 * may be called within that thread (a synchronous model) or within
 * some other thread (an asynchronous model).</p>
 *
 * <p>Applications should not depend on notification dispatch being
 * synchronous or being asynchronous.  Thus:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>Applications should not assume a synchronous model.  When the
 * {@link #sendNotification sendNotification} method returns, it is
 * not guaranteed that every listener's {@link
 * NotificationListener#handleNotification handleNotification} method
 * has been called.  It is not guaranteed either that a listener will
 * see notifications in the same order as they were generated.
 * Listeners that depend on order should use the sequence number of
 * notifications to determine their order (see {@link
 * Notification#getSequenceNumber()}).
 *
 * <li>Applications should not assume an asynchronous model.  If the
 * actions performed by a listener are potentially slow, the listener
 * should arrange for them to be performed in another thread, to avoid
 * holding up other listeners and the caller of {@link
 * #sendNotification sendNotification}.
 *
 * </ul>
