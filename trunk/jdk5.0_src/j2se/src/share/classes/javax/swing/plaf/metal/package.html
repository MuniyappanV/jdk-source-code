Provides user interface objects built according to
the Java look and feel (once codenamed <em>Metal</em>),
which is the default look and feel.

<p>These classes are designed to be used while the
corresponding <code>LookAndFeel</code> class has been
installed
(<code>UIManager.setLookAndFeel(new <i>XXX</i>LookAndFeel())</code>).
Using them while a different <code>LookAndFeel</code> is installed
may produce unexpected results, including exceptions.
Additionally, changing the <code>LookAndFeel</code>
maintained by the <code>UIManager</code> without updating the
corresponding <code>ComponentUI</code> of any
<code>JComponent</code>s may also produce unexpected results,
such as the wrong colors showing up, and is generally not
encouraged.

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>
Most of the Swing API is <em>not</em> thread safe.
