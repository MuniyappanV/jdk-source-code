Provides user interface objects that combine two or more look and feels.
When a component asks
for its UI, this look and feel returns a 
multiplexing UI that handles all communications with both the 
default look and feel and one or more auxiliary look and feels. 
For example, if
a user combines an auxiliary audio look and feel 
with the Motif look and feel,
the <code>JButton.getUI</code> method
would return an instance of <code>MultiButtonUI</code>,
which would handle both a
<code>MotifButtonUI</code> and an <code>AudioButtonUI</code>.
