Provides classes and interfaces for dealing with
<code>javax.swing.JTable</code>. 
<code>JTable</code> is Swing's grid or tabular view for
constructing user interfaces for tabular data structures inside
an application.  Use this package if you want control over how tables
are constructed, updated, and rendered, as well as how data associated
with the tables are viewed and managed.

Most of the Swing API is <em>not</em> thread safe.
