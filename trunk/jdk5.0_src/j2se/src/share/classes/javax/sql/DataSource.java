/** 
 * <p>A factory for connections to the physical data source that this
 * <code>DataSource</code> object represents.  An alternative to the
 * <code>DriverManager</code> facility, a <code>DataSource</code> object
 * is the preferred means of getting a connection. An object that implements
 * the <code>DataSource</code> interface will typically be
 * registered with a naming service based on the 
 * Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Naming and Directory (JNDI) API.
 * <P>
 * The <code>DataSource</code> interface is implemented by a driver vendor.
 * There are three types of implementations:
 * <OL>
 *   <LI>Basic implementation -- produces a standard <code>Connection</code> 
 *       object
 *   <LI>Connection pooling implementation -- produces a <code>Connection</code>
 *       object that will automatically participate in connection pooling.  This
 *       implementation works with a middle-tier connection pooling manager.
 *   <LI>Distributed transaction implementation -- produces a
 *       <code>Connection</code> object that may be used for distributed
 *       transactions and almost always participates in connection pooling. 
 *       This implementation works with a middle-tier 
 *       transaction manager and almost always with a connection 
 *       pooling manager.
 * </OL>
 * <P>
 * A <code>DataSource</code> object has properties that can be modified
 * when necessary.  For example, if the data source is moved to a different
 * server, the property for the server can be changed.  The benefit is that
 * because the data source's properties can be changed, any code accessing
 * that data source does not need to be changed.
 * <P>
 * A driver that is accessed via a <code>DataSource</code> object does not 
 * register itself with the <code>DriverManager</code>.  Rather, a
 * <code>DataSource</code> object is retrieved though a lookup operation
 * and then used to create a <code>Connection</code> object.  With a basic
 * implementation, the connection obtained through a <code>DataSource</code>
 * object is identical to a connection obtained through the
 * <code>DriverManager</code> facility.
