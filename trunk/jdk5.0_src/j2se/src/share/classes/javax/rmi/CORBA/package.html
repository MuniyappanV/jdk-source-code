Contains portability APIs for RMI-IIOP.  These APIs 
provide a standard interface between the generated stubs and ties and the 
RMI-IIOP runtime.  They also allow third party ORBs to be used for RMI over IIOP
as an alternative to the ORB supplied by Sun.  They are not intended to be called
directly from RMI-IIOP applications.  See also the {@link javax.rmi} package.
