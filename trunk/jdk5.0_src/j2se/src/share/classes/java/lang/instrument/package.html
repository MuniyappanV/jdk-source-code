Provides services that allow Java programming language agents to instrument programs running on the JVM. 
The mechanism for instrumentation is modification of the byte-codes of methods.


<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<P>
An agent is launched by indicating the <i>agent class</i> and
its <i>agent options</i> when the JVM is launched.

<P>
The agent class must implement a public static <code>premain</code> method
similar in principle to the <code>main</code> application entry point:
<blockquote>
<code>public static void
premain(String agentArgs, Instrumentation inst);
</code>
</blockquote>

<P>
After the JVM is initialized, each <code>premain</code> method will be called in the order 
the agents were specified, 
then the real application <code>main</code> method will be called.
Each <code>premain</code> method must return in order for the startup sequence to proceed.
The agent class will be loaded by the same classloader
which loads the class containing the application <code>main</code> method.
The <code>premain</code> methods will be run under the same security and classloader 
rules as the application <code>main</code> method.
There are no modeling restrictions on what the agent <code>premain</code> method may do.
Anything application <code>main</code> can do, including spawning threads, is legal from <code>premain</code>.

<P>
Each agent is passed its agent options via the <code>agentArgs</code> parameter.
The agent options are passed as a single string,
any additional parsing should be performed by the agent itself.

<P>
If the agent cannot be resolved 
(for example, because the agent class cannot be loaded,
or because the agent class does not have a conformant <code>premain</code> method), the JVM will abort.
If a <code>premain</code> method throws an uncaught exception, the JVM will abort.


<h2>Command-Line Interface</h2>

On JVMs with a command-line interface, agents are specified by adding this switch to the JVM command-line:
<blockquote>
<code><b>-javaagent:</b></code><i>jarpath[</i><code><b>=</b></code><i>options]</i>
</blockquote>
<i>jarpath</i> is the path to the agent JAR file.
<i>options</i> is the agent options.
This switch may be used multiple times on the same command line, 
thus creating multiple agents.
More than one agent may use the same <i>jarpath</i>.
An agent JAR file must conform to the JAR file specification.
The following manifest attributes are defined for an agent JAR file:
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><code>Premain-Class</dt>
<dd>
                        The agent class.  That is,
                        the class containing the <code>premain</code> method.
                        This attribute is required, if it is not present the
                        JVM will abort.
                        Note: this is a class name, not a file name or path.
</dd>
<dt><code>Boot-Class-Path</dt>
<dd>
                        A list of paths to be searched by the bootstrap class
                        loader. Paths represent directories or libraries
                        (commonly referred to as jar or zip libraries on
                        many platforms).
                        These paths are searched by the
                        bootstrap class loader after the platform specific
                        mechanisms of locating a class have failed.
                        Paths are searched in the order listed.
                        Paths in the list are separated by one or more spaces.
                        A path takes the syntax of the path component of a
                        hierarchical URI. The path is
                        absolute if it begins with a slash character ('/'),
                        otherwise it is relative. A relative path is resolved
                        against the absolute path of the agent JAR file.
                        Malformed and non-existent paths are ignored.
                        This attribute is optional.
</dd>
<dt><code>Can-Redefine-Classes</dt>
<dd>
                        Boolean (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, case irrelevant).
                        Is the ability to redefine classes
                        needed by this agent.
                        Values other than <code>true</code> are considered <code>false</code>.
                        This attribute is optional, the default is <code>false</code>.
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
The agent JAR file is appended to the class path.
