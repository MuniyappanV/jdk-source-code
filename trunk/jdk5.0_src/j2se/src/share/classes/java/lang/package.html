Provides classes that are fundamental to the design of the Java
programming language. The most important classes are <code>Object</code>,
which is the root of the class hierarchy, and <code>Class</code>, instances of
which represent classes at run time.
<p>
Frequently it is necessary to represent a value of primitive type as
if it were an object. The wrapper classes <code>Boolean</code>,
<code>Character</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Long</code>, <code>Float</code>, and
<code>Double</code> serve this purpose. An object of type <code>Double</code>,
for example, contains a field whose type is double, representing that
value in such a way that a reference to it can be stored in a variable
of reference type. These classes also provide a number of methods for
converting among primitive values, as well as supporting such
standard methods as equals and hashCode.  The <code>Void</code> class is a
non-instantiable class that holds a reference to a <code>Class</code> object
represening the primitive type void.
<p>
The class <code>Math</code> provides commonly used mathematical functions such
as sine, cosine, and square root. The classes <code>String</code> and
<code>StringBuffer</code> similarly provide commonly used operations on
character strings.
<p>
Classes <code>ClassLoader</code>, <code>Process</code>, <code>Runtime</code>,
<code>SecurityManager</code>, and <code>System</code> provide "system operations"
that manage the dynamic loading of classes, creation of external processes,
host environment inquiries such as the time of day, and enforcement of
security policies.
<p>
Class <code>Throwable</code> encompasses objects that may be thrown by the
throw statement (&sect;14.16). Subclasses of <code>Throwable</code> represent errors
and exceptions.

<h3>Character Encodings</h3>

The specification of the {@link java.nio.charset.Charset
java.nio.charset.Charset} class describes the naming conventions for character
encodings as well as the set of standard encodings that must be supported by
every implementation of the Java platform.
