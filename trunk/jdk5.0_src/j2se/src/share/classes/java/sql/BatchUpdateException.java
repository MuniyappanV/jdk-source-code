 * An exception thrown when an error
 * occurs during a batch update operation.  In addition to the
 * information provided by {@link SQLException}, a 
 * <code>BatchUpdateException</code> provides the update
 * counts for all commands that were executed successfully during the
 * batch update, that is, all commands that were executed before the error 
 * occurred.  The order of elements in an array of update counts
 * corresponds to the order in which commands were added to the batch.
 * <P>
 * After a command in a batch update fails to execute properly
 * and a <code>BatchUpdateException</code> is thrown, the driver
 * may or may not continue to process the remaining commands in
 * the batch.  If the driver continues processing after a failure,
 * the array returned by the method 
 * <code>BatchUpdateException.getUpdateCounts</code> will have 
 * an element for every command in the batch rather than only
 * elements for the commands that executed successfully before 
 * the error.  In the case where the driver continues processing
 * commands, the array element for any command
 * that failed is <code>Statement.EXECUTE_FAILED</code>.
