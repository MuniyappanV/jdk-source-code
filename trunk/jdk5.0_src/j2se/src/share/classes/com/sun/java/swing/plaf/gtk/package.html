    <h1>GTK Look And Feel</h1>

    <p>
      This package provides the GTK Look and Feel, which is
      implemented on top of the <a href="../synth">Synth Look and Feel</a>.
    <p>
      Rather than having a unique class per <a
href="../synth/Region.html">Region</a> handle the painting, <a
href="GTKPainter.html">GTKPainter</a> handles ALL
      painting. GTKPainter delegates all its painting calls to a <a
href="GTKEngine.html">GTKEngine</a>, which has methods mirroring <a
href="http://www.gtk.org">GTK's</a> <a
href="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/gtkstyle.html">gtkstyleclass</a>.
    <p>
      GTK resource files offer the ability to specify properties that
      will be matched based on object hierarchy. For example,
      GtkWidget allows for specifying the size of the focus rectangle
      through such a property, which can be specified in a resource
      file using the following convention:
<pre>
  GtkWidget::focus-line-width=10
</pre>
    <p>
      <a href="GTKStyle.html">GTKStyle</a> offers support for such
      properties using the <a
href="GTKStyle.html#getClassSpecificValue">getClassSpecificValue</a>
      method or one of its variants, which takes a Region that
      will be mapped to the correspoding Gtk widget and then matched
      based on Gtk's object hierarchy. Certain Synth style properties
      are mapped to the appropriate GTK class specific property were
      appropriate. GTKStyle also contains a static Map of the synth
      specific property values that resembles what was previously in
      the defaults table.
    <p>
      <a href="GTKStyleFactory.html">GTKStyleFactory</a> subclasses <a
href="../synth/DefaultSynthStyleFactory.html">DefaultSynthStyleFactory</a>
      and adds support for GTK specific style
      matching. GTKStyleFactory also maintains a mapping between the
      synth name space and gtk's name space.
