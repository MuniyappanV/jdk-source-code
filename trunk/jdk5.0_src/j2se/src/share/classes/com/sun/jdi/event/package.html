This package defines JDI events and event processing.
An {@link com.sun.jdi.event.Event} is always a member of an 
{@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventSet}, which
is retrieved from the {@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventQueue}. 
Examples of Events include
{@link com.sun.jdi.event.BreakpointEvent "breakpoints events"}, 
{@link com.sun.jdi.event.ThreadStartEvent "thread creation events"} and 
{@link com.sun.jdi.event.VMDeathEvent "virtual machine death event"}. 
With the exception
of termination events, all events received must be requested with an
{@link com.sun.jdi.request.EventRequest "EventRequest"}.  The 
{@link com.sun.jdi.request} package defines event requests and event
request management.
<p>
Methods may be added to the interfaces in the JDI packages in future 
releases. Existing packages may be renamed if the JDI becomes a standard 
extension.
