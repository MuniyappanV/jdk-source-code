/**
 * Request for notification when the target VM terminates.
 * When an enabled VMDeathRequest is satisfied, an
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventSet event set} containing a
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.event.VMDeathEvent VMDeathEvent}
 * will be placed on the
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventQueue EventQueue}.
 * The collection of existing VMDeathRequests is 
 * managed by the {@link EventRequestManager}
 * <P>
 * Even without creating a VMDeathRequest, a single 
 * unsolicited VMDeathEvent will be sent with a 
 * {@link EventRequest#suspendPolicy() suspend policy} 
 * of {@link EventRequest#SUSPEND_NONE SUSPEND_NONE}.
 * This request would typically be created so that a
 * VMDeathEvent with a suspend policy of
 * {@link EventRequest#SUSPEND_ALL SUSPEND_ALL}
 * will be sent.  This event can be used to assure
 * completion of any processing which requires the VM
 * to be alive (e.g. event processing).  Note: the 
 * unsolicited VMDeathEvent will still be sent.
