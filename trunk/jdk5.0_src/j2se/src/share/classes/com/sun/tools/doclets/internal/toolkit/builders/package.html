        This doclet-independent package has a set of classes and 
        interfaces that are the building blocks for doclets. They 
        define the basic structure of doclets and make doclet
        writing much easier because they provide the content generation 
        code to be shared among different doclets. Builders only provide 
        the structure and content of API documentation.
        They will not provide any style markup.
        <p>
        This code is not part of an API.
        It is implementation that is subject to change.
        Do not use it as an API.
