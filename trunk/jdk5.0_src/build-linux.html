  <h2>Introduction</h2></a>
  <blockquote>
    This README file contains build instructions for the 
    Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 Platform 
    Standard Edition, v5.0 (JDK 5.0) Community Source Release.  Building the 
    source code for the JDK requires a high level of technical 
    expertise.  Sun provides the source code primarily for 
    technical experts who want to conduct research, port the platform 
    to new operating systems and hardware, or add enhancements that 
    require access to platform internals.  If you are not a technical 
    professional in one of these categories, this release is probably 
    not for you.

    <h2>Linux System Setup</h2></a>
    <blockquote>
      The official build platform for the JDK 5.0 is Redhat
      Enterprise Advanced Server 2.1. Formerly known as Redhat Advanced Server 2.1.
      <p>
	The minimum recommended hardware for building the Linux version 
	is a Pentium class processor or better, at least 256 MB 
	of RAM, and approximately 1.5 GB of free disk space.
      <p>
        Itanium 64-BIT-ONLY: The official build platform for the itanium 64-bit version of JDK 5.0 is
        Redhat Enterprise Advanced Server 2.1 -  64Bit Edition. The minimum recommended hardware 
        for building the Linux-ia64 version is a Itanium 2 class processor, at least 1 GB of RAM, 
        and approximately 4 GB of free disk space.

      <p>
        AMD 64-BIT-ONLY: The official build platform for the amd 64-bit version of JDK 5.0 is
        Suse 8 Enterprise Server -  AMD64Bit Edition. The minimum recommended hardware 
        for building the Linux-amd64 version is a AMD opteron class processor, at least 512 MB of RAM, 
        and approximately 4 GB of free disk space.

      <p>
	The build uses the tools contained in <tt>/bin</tt> and 
	<tt>/usr/bin</tt> of a standard installation of the 
	Linux operating environment. You should ensure that these directories 
	are on your <tt>PATH</tt>.

      <a name="buildtools">
    <h2>Linux Build Tools and Libraries Setup</h2></a>
    <blockquote>
      Once the Linux OS is set up, you will need to install additional tools and libraries
      for building the JDK.
    </blockquote>

	<a name="binutils">
    <h4>Binutils  (32-bit build only) </h4></a>
    <blockquote>
      The binutils package 2.11.93.0.2-11 or later is required. You can obtain binutils package 2.11.93.0.2-11
      from <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Redhat web site </a>. You need to remove the default binutils package
      shipped with Redhat Enterprise Advanced Server 2.1 and install the required binutils package 2.11.93.0.2-11 
      or later into the default location.
    <p>
    </blockquote>
      
	<a name="gcc">
    <h4>GCC Compiler</h4></a>
    <blockquote>
      A GNU gcc compiler version 3.2.2 is required or gcc 3.2.1-7 
      built with the latest binutils package, version 2.13. This requirement 
      is needed due to the presence of gcc assembler bugs in early versions. 
      You need to remove the default compiler shipped with 
      Redhat Enterprise Advanced Server 2.1 which is 2.96. However if you have a new video card driver, 
      like Geforce 4 it is best to use the same compiler as the kernel was used to build the new module,
      so either build the modules now or rebuild the kernel using gcc 3.x.
      <p>
      Itanium 64-BIT-ONLY:
      The GNU gcc compiler version 2.96 is required.  This compiler is shipped with Red Hat 
	    Enterprise Advanced Server 2.1.
      <p>
      AMD 64-BIT-ONLY:
      The GNU gcc compiler version 3.2.2 is required.  This compiler is shipped with SuSE 8
	    Enterprise Server (SLES). 
      <p>
      The compiler resides in the <tt>/usr/bin</tt> directory. If the compiler resides in a different
	    directory on your machine, then set <tt>ALT_COMPILER_PATH</tt> to point to the location of 
	    the GCC compiler binaries. The GCC compiler binaries must also be in the <tt>PATH</tt>.

    <h4>
      OJI Plug-in library Compiled with GCC 2.9 (32-bit build only)</h4>

    <blockquote>To support Mozilla compiled with GCC egcs 2.91.66 on Linux platform,
      you need to build OJI Plug-in library using GNU gcc/g++ compiler version egcs 2.91.66.
      <p>Case i: Using a single build system
        <br>In this case, both default GCC 3.2 and GCC egcs 2.91.66 are made
        to co-exist in the same build machine. Information on GCC egcs 2.91.66, including download
        sites, is available on the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GNU Gcc web site</a> 
        set <tt>ALT_GCC29_COMPILER_PATH </tt>to point to the location
        of GCC egcs 2.91.66 binary. If the GCC egcs 2.91.66 compiler resides in the 
        <tt>/localtools/usr/bin</tt> directory then you must set <tt>ALT_GCC29_COMPILER_PATH</tt> to 
        <tt>/localtools/usr/</tt>.
      <p>Case ii: Using two build systems
        <br>In this case, you need to build the OJI&nbsp;Plug-in library with GCC egcs 2.91.66
        first before you start your primary linux-i586 build. You can build the OJI Plug-in 
        library on another system where GCC egcs 2.91.66 comes as the default compiler such 
        as RH 6.1. You can follow the guidelines below:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Set up <a href=#mozilla>Mozilla headers</a></li>
           <li>Set up J2SE and Deploy workspaces</li>
           <li>cd into deploy/make/plugin/adapter directory.
           <li>Start the OJI Plug-in library compiled with GCC egcs 2.91.66 build with the command<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>make all </code></li>
           <li>The libjavaplugin_oji.so library will be in the $(OUTPUTDIR)/plugin/i386/ns7-gcc29
                   directory.<br>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>After successfully building the library, copy it to the
        primary build system and set <tt>ALT_GCC29_PLUGIN_LIB_PATH </tt>to
        point to the location of that library.</p>

          As a convenience, the source bundles include an archive
          of motif workspace that incorporate a number of JDK-related
          bug fixes. Target <code> <a href="#build">gnumake scsl </a></code> would automatically take care about
          building our motif workspace and generate motif headers and libraries and

    <blockquote>
      A certificates file named "cacerts" represents a system-wide keystore 
      with CA certificates. In JDK and JRE binary bundles, the "cacerts"
      file contains root CA certificates from several public CAs (e.g., VeriSign,
      Thawte, and Baltimore). 
      <p>      
	The source bundles contain a cacerts file without CA root certificates. 
	JDK builders will need to secure permission from each public CA and
	include the certificates into their own custom cacerts file. Failure to
	provide a populated cacerts file will result in verification of a
	certificate chain during runtime.
      <p>      
	The <tt>ALT_CACERTS_FILE</tt> should be set to point to the location of

    <h4>ALSA (i586, amd64) </h4>
    <blockquote>
      <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org" target="_blank">Advanced Linux Sound 
	Architecture</a> version 0.9.1 or later is required for building the 
      JDK.
      <p>
	Most modern Linux distributions ship with ALSA. On rpm-based systems,
	you can see if ALSA is installed by running this command:
	<pre>
         rpm -qa | grep alsa</pre>
      Both <code>alsa</code> and <code>alsa-devel</code> packages are needed.
      <p>
	If your distribution does not come with ALSA, you can install 
	pre-built ALSA rpm packages, for example 
	from <a href="http://www.freshrpms.net/" target="_blank">Fresh RPMs</a>. 
	Make sure that you do not link to the static library (<tt>libasound.a</tt>),
	by verifying that the dynamic library (<tt>libasound.so</tt>) is correctly 
	installed in <tt>/usr/lib</tt>.
      <p>
	If you are unable to find a pre-built ALSA package,
	you need to build it from the source distribution:
	Download driver and library source tarballs from <a 
	  href="http://www.alsa-project.org" target="_blank">ALSA's 
	  homepage</a>. As root, execute the following commands (you may need to 
	adapt the version number):<br>
      <pre>
      $ tar xjf alsa-driver-0.9.1.tar.bz2
      $ cd alsa-driver-0.9.1
      $ ./configure
      $ make install
      $ cd ..
      $ tar xjf alsa-lib-0.9.1.tar.bz2
      $ cd alsa-lib-0.9.1
      $ ./configure
      $ make install</pre>

      Should one of the above steps fail, refer to the documentation on ALSA's
      home page. Note that this is a minimum install that enables building the 
      JDK platform. To actually use ALSA sound drivers, more steps are necessary
      as outlined in the documentation on ALSA's homepage.<br>

      ALSA can be uninstalled by executing <tt>make uninstall</tt> first in the 
      <code>alsa-lib-0.9.1</code> directory and then in 
      <code>alsa-driver-0.9.1</code>.
