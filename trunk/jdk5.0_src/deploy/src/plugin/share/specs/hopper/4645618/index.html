<h4> 1.1 Overview</h4>
 <!-- Description of the project/problem -->  The steps needed to successfully 
register the plugin, with the container, have become to complex for direct 
user execution. &nbsp;While the particular steps for any one container may 
not be so overwhelming, the growing number of containers and their individual 
idiosyncrasies make it imperative that we assist the user in some way. &nbsp;A 
user in this case might be and end user, a developer creating an installation 
script, or anyone else concerned with plugin registration.<br>
 <br>
 As such, we need to insure that, if the user knows certain information about 
their environment, they should not have to know the details of plugin/container 
registration.<br>
 <br>
 The information a user could be expected to know:<br>
 <br>
 The location of the container installation they wish to register with.<br>
 The location of the JRE they wish to register with.<br>
 The scheme of registration their container employs, from the plugin point 
of view.<br>
 <br>
 Additionally, once a solution is arrived at and made available, it should 
be expected to be available for the foreseeable development life of the plugin. 
&nbsp;In other words, once it is out there, users should be able to depend 
on it still being there and being consistent for as long as we produce versions 
of the plugin.<br>
 
<h4> 1.2 Project Dependencies </h4>
   <!-- Describe any dependencies on other projects -->   
<h4> 1.3 OS and Browser Compatibility and Interpretability</h4>
 Netscape 4.X Netscape 6.X on all supported UNIX platforms<br>
   <!-- Describe any compatibility or interoperability issues.  Is this
     project a cross platform solution, or does it only affect certain
     platforms/browsers?  Is this compatible with earlier and future
     releases? -->
    
<p>   </p>
 
<h4> 1.4 Performance and Scalability</h4>
 Performance should not be a gating factor, since we should expect this to 
be a one time execution for any given container/plugin combination. &nbsp;Scalability 
needs to be considered since it is clear that additional containers will need
to be supported latter down the line. 
<h4> 1.5 Security</h4>

   <!-- Describe any security related issues. -->

<h4> 2.1 Architecture</h4>
 Key to this architecture is the assumption that the user has some basic
knowledge (see overview). &nbsp;It is well within reason to believe that
the user knows or could figure out where to find the installation location
of both the container and Java. &nbsp;It is not reasonable to assume however,
that the user will know anything about how their container expects the plugin
to register with it. &nbsp;As such, we solve this problem today by providing
manual steps for the user to follow for their container type. &nbsp;This
architecture replaces the need for the user to follow the manual steps, with
an automated system based on the method of container registration. &nbsp;In
short, a script that does what the user would have done manually, assuming
they can tell us which set of steps (by a name we provide) they would have
chosen. &nbsp;This "named" set of steps MUST be document. &nbsp;Perhaps in
some kind of table, such as:<br>
 <br>
 Browser&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steps name<br>
 <br>
 N4.X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Name1, Name2<br>
 etc...<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Each set of steps should be distinguished in the documentation as to which 
is preferred, for a given container,&nbsp; should more then one be available.<br>
 <br>
 A good candidate for this script is the "ControlPanel". &nbsp;It already 
exists within the plugin distribution. &nbsp;It lives in a well know place, 
and what we are talking about here is something that fits into the idea of 
a ControlPanel naturally.<br>
 <br>
 So, we will modify the ControlPanel script to take a set of arguments (see 
Exported Interfaces) and register the plugin accordingly. &nbsp;Further, should
arguments be provided the ControlPanel should assume it is being used for
registration and NOT bring up its UI.     
<p>   </p>
 
<h4> 2.2 Exported Interfaces/API</h4>
 ControlPanel [ ( -r scheme | -u scheme ) -c path -j path ]<br>
 <br>
 This means that, arguments to the ControlPanel are optional, but must be 
specified completely if they are to be used at all. &nbsp;Each argument means:<br>
 <br>
 -r &nbsp;scheme | -u scheme: register or unregister the plugin, respectively 
using the supplied scheme. &nbsp;only one switch should be specified and only
the last one specified will be honored. (for "scheme" values and their meaning
see below)<br>
 <br>
 -c path: specify where the ControlPanel script can find the installation 
location of the container (as indicated by "path")<br>
 <br>
 -j path: specify where the ControlPanel script can find the installation 
location of Java (as indicated by "path")<br>
 <br>
 Clearly, it should be possible for the ControlPanel to figure out the information 
supplied by the "-j" argument by default since by definition the ControlPanel 
lives inside the distribution. &nbsp;This is not appropriate however, since 
the information we are really asking for is: "How does the given container 
locate the Java installation?" &nbsp;That is, the path a given container might
use in not necessarily the same path we would deduce from our location.<br>
 <br>
 Initially, the following scheme (scheme names) should be supported:<br>
 <br>
 ns4: the container uses the Netscape 4.X method of setting the NPX_PLUGIN_PATH 
variable, the script should return the value that the variable should be set
to.<br>
 ns4l: the container uses the Netscape 4.X method that assumes a plugin directory, 
a link is made from the directory to the plugin.<br>
 <br>
 ns600: the container uses the Netscape 6.X method that assumes a plugin
directory, a link is made from the directory to the plugin<br>
 <br>
 ns610: the container uses the Netscape 6.X method that assumes the existence 
of "regxpcom" which is executed on the plugin<br>
 ns610l: the container uses the Netscape 6.X method that assumes the existence 
of a plugins directory, a link is made from the directory to the plugin.<br>
   <!-- List and describe any new or changed exported interfaces
     or APIs. -->
    
<p>   </p>
 
<h4> 2.3 Imported Interfaces/API </h4>
   <!-- List and describe any new or changed imported interfaces
     or APIs which are of significance to note. -->
    
<p>   </p>
 
<h4> 2.4 User Interface</h4>
 
<h4></h4>
 As an example suppose the installation script for Sun verision of Netscape 
6.2.1 wished to register the plugin. &nbsp;We assume that both the JRE and 
Netscape have been installed by pkgadd in their default locations, but the 
actuall installation script would be free to chose some other values for the
installation locations based on its needs.<br>
 <br>
 The command the script would run would look like:<br>
 <br>
 /usr/java/bin/ControlPanel -r ns610 -c /opt/SUNWns6 -j /usr/java<br>

<h4> A. Background Information</h4>
 
<h4></h4>
 Numerous problems lead to the need for this proposal. &nbsp;Chief among
them where the inability to properly communicate the steps to register the
plugin to the world as a whole and to groups inside Sun in particular. &nbsp;Additionally, 
several customers have complained that the registration process should be 
easier. &nbsp;Once this system is in place the hope is that groups that supply 
products that wish to use the plugin will find this method more reliable and
predictable and as such make more of an effort to connect to the plugin during
their installation process.<br>
