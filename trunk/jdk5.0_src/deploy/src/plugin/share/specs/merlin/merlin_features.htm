<h1 align="center"><b>Java Plug-in Proposed Features for Merlin</b></h1>
<p align="center">By <a href="mailto:stanley.ho@eng.sun.com">Stanley Man-Kit Ho</a></p>
<hr>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Java Plug-in is part of the
client-side Java deployment strategy of the Merlin release. To broaden the usage
of Java on the client side, several new features are proposed in the Java
Plug-in in the Merlin release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open JVM Integration (OJI) support for enabling applets running inside
    the upcoming Netscape 6 using Java 2 as the native JVM.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Applet usability support for enhancing user experience of using applets
    through Java Plug-in.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Common DOM API support for enabling applets communicate more directly with
    the browser's document object model in Internet Explorer 5.0 and Netscape
    6.0.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Client-side Java installation guideline for enabling various version of
    Java Development Kit (JDK)/Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to coexist with
    each other, and providing a deterministic way for application installer to
    locate the JDK/JRE on the machine.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the above features, applets and
applications on the client-sides will be much more friendly and usable to the
users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Open JVM Integration (OJI)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OJI is a jointed effort between
Netscape and Sun Microsystems, Inc. to develop a set of APIs that enables
third-party vendors to plug in their JRE as the native Java environment in the
upcoming Netscape 6.0 product. OJI will enable the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>APPLET / EMBED / OBJECT tag support<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Java and JavaScript bi-directional communication (LiveConnect)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>RSA signed applet verification through Netscape 6.0 certificate store.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Various browser integration<br>
    <br>
    -&nbsp; Enable/Disable Java Console through Netscape 6.0 menu<br>
    -&nbsp; Enable/Disable Java through Netscape 6.0 menu<br>
    -&nbsp; Applet lifecycle<br>
    -&nbsp; Proxy configuration support<br>
    -&nbsp; Cookie support<br>
    -&nbsp; HTTPS support<br>
    -&nbsp; Automatic download if JRE not present<br>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OJI will allow Java 2 to be used
as Netscape 6.0 native JVM through Java Plug-in, and it will match every
features in the existing native JVM in IE 3/4/5 and NS 3/4. Since Netscape
6.0 will be distributed with Java 2 to millions to users, OJI will enable Java 2
to compete head-to-head with native JVM in IE and older version of Navigator. In
Merlin, OJI will be supported in Java Plug-in on Win32, Solaris and Linux.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Applet Usability Improvement</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applet usability improvement is a
set of enhancement to various features Java Plug-in features. The enhancement
will be mainly in the user interface area, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increases response time of the browsers during Java 2 startup by loading
    JVM asynchronously.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Provides progress feedback when applets are downloaded.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Adds or improves messages in the error dialog while error occurs in Java
    Plug-in, including RSA signed applet verification, optional package
    installation, etc.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Enables Java Console to be re-opened by introducing icons in the taskbar
    in Win32, and by introducing &quot;Java Plug-in Console&quot; menu item in
    IE.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applet usability improvement will
allow Java Plug-in to be more developer and user friendly when deploying
applets. In Merlin, applet usability improvement will be supported in Java
Plug-in on Win32, Solaris and Linux.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Common DOM API </h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common DOM API is a set of new
Java APIs for applets to access the browser document object model (DOM) much
easier in Internet Explorer 5.0 and Netscape 6.0. The APIs will be based on the
W3C DOM Level 1 Specification. While the W3C specification defines interfaces
for various DOM objects, it does not define how to obtain the DOM objects in the
first place. Therefore, certain Java APIs will be introduced in the
com.sun.browser namespaces to expose the DOM objects. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full support for W3C DOM Level 1
is expected in Java Plug-in on Win32 (IE &amp; NS) and on Solaris in Merlin. </p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Client-side Java Installation Guideline</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Client-side Java installation
guideline is a set of suggestions to various JVM vendors, developers, and
installer companies to support an unified client-side Java&nbsp; experience. The
guideline provides suggestions for the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>How JDK/JRE should be installed in user machine, including installation
    location, registry key settings, etc., so JDK/JRE from various vendors
    installed in the same machine will not step over each other. This is
    particularly important when installing minor-version of JDK/JRE, or the same
    version of JDK/JRE from different vendors. Also, installer companies will be
    able to build installer that could locate the JDK/JRE much easier, without
    performing a brute-force search in the file system.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>How Java applications and applets should be installed in user machine,
    including installation location, registry key settings, desktop
    icons/shortcuts, etc. Users will be able to launch various Java applications
    and Java applets in an unified way, even these applications and applets are
    installed through different installers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>How Java applications and applets should be uninstalled in user machine,
    so these applications and applets installed through different installer
    would be uninstalled in an unified way.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By following this guideline, JDK/JRE,
Java applications and applets would be installed in a deterministic and unified
way on each platform, instead of installed randomly . This guideline is not
intended to be the same on various platforms; rather, each platform will be
treated as unique, and different guidelines will be suggested. In Merlin, we
will provide client-side Java installation guideline for Win32, Solaris and
Linux.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional: In an ideal situation,
this guideline will be adapted by installer companies like InstallShield and
ZeroG, so developers using these installers will be able to install Java
applications and applets that conform to the guideline. Otherwise, developers
will have to take care of a lot of details like generating registry key settings
during installation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ease the effort to build the installer
that follows this guideline, we will provide a set of client-side Java
installation APIs (native/Java) to the installer companies, if necessary. The purpose of these APIs
is for allowing Java applications and applets to be installed in its native
platform, by following the guideline. These APIs will take care of things like creating icon on the desktop, providing
un-installation or others, so developers may call these APIs from their
installers to install/uninstall Java applications and applets, without rewriting
these logics in their installation scripts every time. All the installation details will be ultimately controlled and encapsulated in these APIs, and we
will be sure that all the Java applications and applets will be installed/uninstalled uniformly within the native platform.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OJI, applet usability improvement,
Common DOM API, and client-side Java installation guideline are four new features in Java
Plug-in in the Merlin release. However, we will continue to enhance existing
Java Plug-in features like RSA signed applet support, sticky applet support and
others, to make client-side Java much easier to use for end-users in Merlin.</p>
