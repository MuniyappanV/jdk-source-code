<h1 align="center"><b>Open JVM Integration (OJI) support in Java Plug-in</b></h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open JVM Integration (OJI) is an
initiative between Sun and Netscape to enable third-party JVM vendors to plug in
their JRE as the native Java environment in the upcoming Netscape 6 browser. A
set of OJI APIs are defined by Netscape and are exposed in Netscape 6. Java
Plug-in will support the full set of OJI APIs, and be bundled with Netscape 6 on
Win32 and Solaris. This document summaries the features that OJI will enable.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>OJI Features</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basic goal for OJI is to match
every single feature in the browser native JVM. The following are the features
enabled by OJI:</p>
<ul>
  <li>APPLET / EMBED / OBJECT tag support<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users and developers will be able
    to launch applets using the regular HTML APPLET tag and the Java Plug-in
    style of EMBED/OBJECT tag. For more information about the Java Plug-in style
    of EMBED/OBJECT tag, please consult the Java Plug-in HTML Specification.
    Since the OJI plug-in on Win32 and Solaris will be shipped with Java 2 with
    Netscape 6, applets in the Internet using the APPLET tag will automatically
    gain access to the full functionalities of Java 2.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Java and JavaScript bi-directional communication (LiveConnect)<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HTML authors will be able to
    access the method of the applets from JavaScript through JavaScript-to-Java
    communication using LiveConnect. Applet authors will&nbsp; be able to have
    full access in the browser's document object model from Java through
    Java-to-JavaScript communication through netscape.javascript.JSObject in
    LiveConnect as well.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>RSA signed applet verification through Netscape 6.0 certificate store<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Java Plug-in has supported RSA
    signed applet since the Cricket release (J2SE, v1.2.2). However, in Netscape
    6, Java Plug-in will support RSA signed applet verification through Netscape
    6 certificate store instead of the Java Plug-in certificate store. This
    enable both the Netscape 6 browser and Java runtime to share a single
    certificate store for signed applet verification.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Various browser integration<br>
    <br>
    -&nbsp; Applet Usability Enhancement<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure applets are easy to be used and ease the effort
    of supporting Java Plug-in in Netscape 6, part of the applet usability
    enhancement that are planned for Merlin will be available in OJI as well. It
    includes applet progress status support, tracing support, Java Console
    enhancement, etc. Please consult the Applet Usability Specification for more
    details.<br>
    <br>
    -&nbsp; Enable/Disable Java Console through Netscape 6 browser menu<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Java Console can be opened and closed directly from the
    Netscape 6 browser menu.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    -&nbsp; Enable/Disable Java through Netscape 6.0 browser menu<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Java can be enabled&nbsp; and disabled directly from the
    Netscape 6 browser menu.<br>
    <br>
    -&nbsp; Applet lifecycle<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applet lifecycle will behave the same as the browser JVM.
    In the beginning, the applet will be loaded and started. In any page-switch
    situation, applets will be stopped, and restarted if the page is resumed.
    However, the browser may stop and destroy the applet at any time, according
    to its applet pruning policy. In previous release of Netscape Navigator,
    applets will be pruned when the number of running applets are more than 10.<br>
    <br>
    -&nbsp; Proxy configuration support<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike previous release of Java Plug-in, proxy
    configuration information will be directly provided by the browser for a
    given URL. Therefore, proxy configuration of any connection made by applets
    in Netscape 6 will be determined by the browser itself instead of Java
    Plug-in.<br>
    <br>
    -&nbsp; Cookie support<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookie will be directly provided by the browser for a
    given URL. Therefore, cookie of any HTTP/HTTPS request made by applets in
    Netscape 6 will be determined by the browser itself instead of Java Plug-in<br>
    <br>
    -&nbsp; HTTPS support<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to previous release of Java Plug-in, HTTPS
    support will be provided by the browser.<br>
    <br>
    -&nbsp; Automatic download if JRE not present<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User installing Netscape 6 may not install the JRE by
    default. Therefore, it is very important to automatically install the JRE
    when the user haven't installed the JRE when applet is first used in
    Netscape 6. This will be achieved through the new SmartUpdate mechanism in
    Netscape 6.<br>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Backward Compatibility</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since OJI will enable Java 2 to be
used as the default browser VM to execute applets in the Internet, these applets
may not work if they use specific browser VM APIs or depends on specific browser
VM behavior. Although we will ensure backward compatibility between Java 2 and
Netscape VM as much as possible. However, we will neither guarantee nor commit
that the compatibility will be 100%. Some applets may work with Java 2
out-of-the box. Some other applets may work with Java 2 by a simple
recompilation. However, some other applet developers may find themselves
spending times to port their applets to Java 2. This is our responsibility (Sun,
in general) to ensure that customers are aware of this compatibility issues, and
should not expect 100% backward compatibility between Java 2 and Netscape VM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Existing Java Plug-in Features</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although OJI will enable all the
OJI features in Java Plug-in, all the existing functionalities in Java Plug-in
will still continue to work in Netscape 6. Therefore, customers can not only
take advantages of the new features available through OJI, but they can also
leverage the existing Java Plug-in features in Netscape 6 as well.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Conclusion</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OJI support is a new feature in
the upcoming Java
Plug-in release. It will enable Java 2 as the default browser Java runtime on
Win32 and Solaris, and provide latest Java 2 functionalities to applets in the
Internet and the Intranet through Netscape 6. Since Netscape 6 will be distributed with Java 2 to millions to users, OJI will enable Java 2
to compete head-to-head with native JVM in IE and older version of Navigator.&nbsp;</p>
