<h4> 1.1 Overview</h4>
  As of this writing the build system for the Plugin consists of three separate
 schemes. &nbsp;In no particular order, the general UNIX scheme, the general
 Windows scheme and the scheme for building the HTML Converter.<br>
  <br>
  The general UNIX scheme uses a single Makefile that contains the build
instructions  for each target and includes additional Makefile that contain
file information.  &nbsp;The Makefiles in this scheme are written for GNU
Make.<br>
  <br>
  The general Windows scheme uses multiple Makefiles. &nbsp;Each one of which
 builds a sub directory of the source for the Windows plugin. &nbsp;Recursive
 calls are made from a top level Makefile to build each of the targets known
 to the sub Makefiles. &nbsp;The Makefile in this scheme are written for
nmake.<br>
  <br>
  The HTML Converter uses a single Makefile and includes additional Makefiles
 like the general UNIX scheme. &nbsp;In this scheme however the Makefile
itself  determines which platform it is building for and acts appropriately.
&nbsp;The  Makefile in this scheme is written for GNU make.<br>
  <br>
  It should be intuitively obvious that having three different schemes for
 building the Plugin is not a desirable situation. &nbsp;As such it is the
 intent of this project to reduce this complexity down to a single method
of organizing the build instructions for different targets. &nbsp;Also this
project will standardize on a single make system.<br>

<h4> 2.1 Architecture</h4>
  It is my opinion that the best course of action we can take is to adopt 
a scheme that incorporates elements from each of those mentioned above. &nbsp;As
 such we should:<br>
  <br>
  1) Standardize on GNU make.<br>
  This is the build mechanism used by the rest of Java.<br>
  <br>
  2) Use recursive make to build sub-parts of the Plugin.<br>
  It should be possible to decompose the plugin into it's actual deliverables.
 &nbsp;Each of these deliverables should have it's own sub directory that
contains it's own &nbsp;Makefile. &nbsp;Makefiles that live in sub directories
should be completely self contained. &nbsp;That is, they should not depend
on inheriting variable values from the Makefile that might call them. &nbsp;The
JRE provides a set of includable Makefiles that define common values. &nbsp;These
should be included by each sub directory Makefile. &nbsp;Additionally, Plugin
specific variable should live in includable Makefiles controlled by the Plugin
team.<br>
  <br>
  Deliverables should be thought of as file system artifacts such as scripts,
 shared libraries, etc. &nbsp;Deliverables should be grouped together by
upper  level targets to &nbsp;facilitate building. &nbsp;For example, there
would be an upper level target that builds the Netscape 4 plugin called ns4.
&nbsp;This  target would depend on each of the deliverables that would actually
compose  the complete Netscape 4 plugin, such as the Control Panel, the libjavaplugin.so
 file, etc. &nbsp;For some deliverables it might make sense to combine them
 into a single sub directory Makefile. &nbsp;For example, the Control Panel
 is actually composed of several file system artifacts, but since no other
 part of the plugin depends on them they need not be separated out. &nbsp;The
 counter example to this would be something like the java_vm command. &nbsp;It
 is needed by both the UNIX Netscape 4 and 6 plugins so should be in it's
own sub directory Makefile.<br>
  <br>
  3) Separate out analogous deliverables by including different Makefiles 
in a single controling Makefile, not by introducing additional sub directory 
Makefiles. &nbsp;By this, it is meant that if two deliverable perform the 
same conceptual functions a single Makefile should build both by including 
different specific Makefiles. &nbsp;For example, both the Windows and UNIX 
plugins build a shared object that is loaded into Netscape 4. &nbsp;Instead 
of having two separate sub directories, one that builds the UNIX version and
one that builds the Windows version. &nbsp;There should be a single sub directory
Makefile that includes into itself a platform specific Makefile that has
the proper commands and targets for the given platform. &nbsp;In the long
run, this will make it easier to combine together source that does essentially
the same thing but for different platforms. &nbsp;It also means a developer
will only have to look in one place to figure out the things that are similar
between the platforms.<br>
  <br>
  4) When applicable, the Makefiles will build debug as well as optimized 
versions of all deliverable. &nbsp;This will be done internal to the Makefile, 
not as a result of two recursive calls.<br>
  <br>
  With this in mind, here is a partial list of targets and deliverables:<br>
  <br>
  all: &nbsp;all the deliverables<br>
  ns4: all the deliverables needed to have a complete plugin for Netscape 
4<br>
  ns6: all the deliverables needed to have a complete plugin for Netscape 
6<br>
  ie: all the deliverables needed to have a complete plugin for IE<br>
  <br>
  libjavaplugin.so: <br>
  javaplugin.so:<br>
  np*:<br>
  controlpanel:<br>
  htmlconverter:<br>
  javaplugin.jar:<br>
  java_vm: <br>
  <br>
  The standard house keeping targets (clobber etc.) will be implemented where
 appropriate by each sub directory Makefile<br>
  <br>
  Targets for installation will be handled by both the upper level Makefile
 and the sub directory Makefiles as needed.<br>
