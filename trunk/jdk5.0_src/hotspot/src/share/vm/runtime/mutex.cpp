// ON THE VMTHREAD SNEAKING PAST HELD LOCKS:
// In particular, there are certain types of global lock that may be held
// by a Java thread while it is blocked at a safepoint but before it has
// written the _owner field. These locks may be sneakily acquired by the
// VM thread during a safepoint to avoid deadlocks. Alternatively, one should
// identify all such locks, and ensure that Java threads never block at
// safepoints while holding them (_no_safepopint_check_flag). While it
// seems as though this could increase the time to reach a safepoint
// (or at least increase the mean, if not the variance), the latter
// approach might make for a cleaner, more maintainable JVM design.
